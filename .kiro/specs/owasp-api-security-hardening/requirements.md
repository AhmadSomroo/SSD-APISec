# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the systematic hardening of an intentionally vulnerable Spring Boot API application that demonstrates the OWASP API Security Top 10 vulnerabilities. The application currently contains critical security flaws including plaintext password storage, broken authentication, excessive data exposure, mass assignment vulnerabilities, and inadequate access controls. The goal is to transform this vulnerable application into a secure, production-ready API while maintaining functionality and providing comprehensive testing to validate security improvements.

## Glossary

- **API_Security_System**: The Spring Boot application being secured against OWASP API Top 10 vulnerabilities
- **Authentication_Service**: JWT-based authentication mechanism for user login and token management
- **Authorization_Service**: Role-based access control system for protecting resources
- **Password_Service**: BCrypt-based password hashing and validation system
- **Rate_Limiter**: Request throttling mechanism to prevent abuse and brute-force attacks
- **DTO_System**: Data Transfer Object layer for controlling data exposure
- **Validation_Service**: Input validation and sanitization system
- **Audit_System**: Security logging and monitoring system

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Password Security Implementation

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want all passwords to be securely hashed using BCrypt, so that user credentials are protected even if the database is compromised.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers, THE Password_Service SHALL hash the password using BCrypt with minimum cost factor 12
2. WHEN a user authenticates, THE Authentication_Service SHALL validate passwords using BCrypt comparison
3. WHEN the application starts, THE API_Security_System SHALL migrate existing plaintext passwords to BCrypt hashes
4. THE Password_Service SHALL reject passwords shorter than 8 characters
5. THE API_Security_System SHALL never store or log plaintext passwords

### Requirement 2: Access Control Hardening

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want strict authentication and authorization controls on all API endpoints, so that only authorized users can access protected resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Authorization_Service SHALL require authentication for all endpoints except /api/auth/login and /api/auth/register
2. WHEN an unauthenticated request accesses protected endpoints, THE API_Security_System SHALL return HTTP 401
3. THE Authorization_Service SHALL enforce role-based access control for admin endpoints
4. WHEN a non-admin user accesses admin endpoints, THE API_Security_System SHALL return HTTP 403
5. THE API_Security_System SHALL remove permitAll configuration from /api/** GET endpoints

### Requirement 3: Resource Ownership Enforcement

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access only my own resources, so that my data remains private and secure from other users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests account information, THE API_Security_System SHALL verify the account belongs to the authenticated user
2. WHEN a user attempts to access another user's resources, THE API_Security_System SHALL return HTTP 403
3. THE API_Security_System SHALL map JWT subject to user identity for ownership validation
4. THE Authorization_Service SHALL validate resource ownership before processing any resource-specific requests
5. THE API_Security_System SHALL prevent horizontal privilege escalation attacks

### Requirement 4: Data Exposure Control

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want to control what data is exposed through API responses, so that sensitive information is not leaked to clients.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE DTO_System SHALL exclude password fields from all API responses
2. THE DTO_System SHALL exclude role and isAdmin fields from user creation responses
3. WHEN returning user data, THE API_Security_System SHALL use response DTOs instead of entity objects
4. THE DTO_System SHALL provide separate DTOs for different access levels
5. THE API_Security_System SHALL never expose internal system information in error responses

### Requirement 5: Rate Limiting Implementation

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want rate limiting on critical endpoints, so that the application is protected from abuse and brute-force attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Rate_Limiter SHALL limit login attempts to 5 requests per minute per IP address
2. THE Rate_Limiter SHALL limit account transfer operations to 10 requests per minute per user
3. WHEN rate limits are exceeded, THE API_Security_System SHALL return HTTP 429
4. THE Rate_Limiter SHALL implement sliding window rate limiting
5. THE Rate_Limiter SHALL provide different limits for authenticated vs anonymous users

### Requirement 6: Mass Assignment Prevention

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want to prevent clients from modifying sensitive fields through API requests, so that privilege escalation is prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE DTO_System SHALL use request DTOs that exclude role and isAdmin fields
2. WHEN creating users, THE API_Security_System SHALL ignore role and isAdmin values from request body
3. THE Validation_Service SHALL validate all incoming request data against allowed fields
4. THE API_Security_System SHALL set default role as "USER" and isAdmin as false for new users
5. THE DTO_System SHALL prevent binding of sensitive fields during deserialization

### Requirement 7: JWT Security Hardening

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want robust JWT token security, so that authentication tokens cannot be compromised or misused.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Authentication_Service SHALL use a cryptographically strong secret key from environment variables
2. THE Authentication_Service SHALL set JWT token lifetime to maximum 15 minutes
3. THE Authentication_Service SHALL include issuer and audience claims in all tokens
4. WHEN validating tokens, THE Authentication_Service SHALL verify issuer, audience, and signature
5. THE Authentication_Service SHALL reject tokens with invalid or missing security claims

### Requirement 8: Error Handling Security

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want secure error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information, so that attackers cannot gain system insights from error messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE API_Security_System SHALL return generic error messages to clients in production
2. THE Audit_System SHALL log detailed error information server-side for debugging
3. THE API_Security_System SHALL never expose stack traces in API responses
4. THE API_Security_System SHALL implement custom exception handlers for security-related errors
5. THE Audit_System SHALL log security events including failed authentication attempts

### Requirement 9: Input Validation Enhancement

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want comprehensive input validation, so that malicious or invalid data cannot compromise the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Validation_Service SHALL reject negative transfer amounts
2. THE Validation_Service SHALL enforce maximum transfer limits per transaction
3. THE Validation_Service SHALL validate all numeric inputs for reasonable ranges
4. THE Validation_Service SHALL sanitize string inputs to prevent injection attacks
5. THE API_Security_System SHALL return HTTP 400 for invalid input with descriptive messages

### Requirement 10: Security Testing Implementation

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want comprehensive security tests, so that all vulnerabilities are verified as fixed and security controls are validated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE API_Security_System SHALL pass all authentication bypass tests
2. THE API_Security_System SHALL pass all authorization escalation tests
3. THE API_Security_System SHALL pass all data exposure validation tests
4. THE API_Security_System SHALL pass all mass assignment prevention tests
5. THE API_Security_System SHALL demonstrate rate limiting effectiveness through integration tests
